        <p>Effective 22 May 2024 | <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms/archive">Archived versions</a> | <a href="https://www.gstatic.com/policies/terms/pdf/20240522/ks8shls0/google_terms_of_service_en-GB.pdf">Download PDF</a></p>

        <h3>What’s covered in these terms</h3>
        <h3>We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google <a class="active-link" href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-SA&fg=1#footnote-services"> services</a>, and what we expect from you.</h3>
        <p>These Terms of Service reflect <a href="https://about.google/intl/en-GB_SA/how-our-business-works">the way that Google’s business works</a>, the laws that apply to our company, and <a href="https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html?hl=en_GB">certain things that we’ve always believed to be true</a>. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#toc-what-you-expect">What you can expect from us</a>, which describes how we provide and develop our services</li>
            <li><a href="#what-we-expect-from-you">What we expect from you</a>, which establishes certain rules for using our services</li>
            <li><a href="#content"> Content in Google services</a>, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content that you find in our services – whether that content belongs to you, Google or others</li>
            <li>In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights that you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Understanding these terms is important because, by accessing or using our services, you're agreeing to these terms.</p>
        <p>Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export and delete your information.</p>

            <h2>What you can expect from us</h2>
            <h3>Provide a broad range of useful services</h3>
            <p>We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>apps and sites (like Search and Maps)</li>
                <li>platforms (like Google Shopping)</li>

                <li>devices (like Google Nest and Pixel)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Develop, improve and update Google services</h3>
            <p>We're constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware.</p>

            <h2>What we expect from you</h2>
            <h3>Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms</h3>
            <p>The permission that we give you to access and use our services continues as long as you comply with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>these terms</li>
                <li>service-specific additional terms, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Respect others</h3>
            <p>We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means that you must follow these basic rules of conduct:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions and human trafficking laws</li>
                <li>respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights</li>
                <li>don't abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Content in Google services</h2>
            <h3>Your content</h3>
            <p>Some of our services allow you to generate original content. Google won't claim ownership over that content.</p>

            <h3>Google content</h3>
            <p>Some of our services include content that belongs to Google – for example, many of the visual illustrations that you see in Google Maps. You may use Google's content as allowed by these terms and any service-specific additional terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content.</p>

            <h3>Other content</h3>
            <p>Finally, some of our services give you access to content that belongs to other people or organisations. You may not use this content without that person or organisation's permission, or as otherwise allowed by law.</p>
