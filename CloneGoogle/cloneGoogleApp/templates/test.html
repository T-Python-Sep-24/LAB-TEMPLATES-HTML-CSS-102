    <h2>What's covered in these terms</h2>
    <p>We know it's tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it's important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google services, and what we expect from you.</p>
    <p>These Terms of Service reflect the way that Google's business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things that we've always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google's relationship with you as you interact with our services.</p>

    <div class="sub-section">
        <h4>What's covered</h4>
        <p>This licence covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.</p>

        <h4>What's not covered</h4>
        <p>This licence doesn't affect your privacy rights – it's only about your intellectual property rights</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>This licence is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>worldwide, which means that it's valid anywhere in the world</li>
        <li>non-exclusive, which means that you can licence your content to others</li>
        <li>royalty-free, which means that there are no monetary fees for this licence</li>
    </ul>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Software in Google services</h2>
    <p>Some of our services include downloadable or preloaded software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.</p>

    <h2>In case of problems or disagreements</h2>
    <h3>Warranty</h3>
    <p>We provide our services using reasonable skill and care. If we don't meet the quality level described in this warranty, you agree to tell us and we'll work with you to try to resolve the issue.</p>

    <h3>Disclaimers</h3>
    <p>The only commitments that we make about our services are provided in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the Warranty section</li>
        <li>the service-specific additional terms</li>
        <li>laws that can't be limited by these terms</li>
    </ul>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Liabilities</h2>
    <h3>For all users</h3>
    <p>Both the law and these terms try to strike a balance as to what you or Google can claim from the other in case of problems. These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law.</p>

    <h3>For business users and organisations only</h3>
    <p class="highlight">If you're a business user or organisation, Google's total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) US $500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Taking action in case of problems</h2>
    <h3>Removing your content</h3>
    <p>If we reasonably believe that any of your content breaches these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies, violates applicable law, or could harm our users, third parties or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <h3>Suspending or terminating your access to Google services</h3>
    <p>Google may suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>you materially or repeatedly breach these terms</li>
        <li>we're required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order</li>
        <li>we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party or Google</li>
    </ul>

<section class="section">
    <h2>About these terms</h2>
    <p>By law, you have certain rights that can't be limited by a contract like these Terms of Service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.</p>
    <p>These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don't create any legal rights for other people or organisations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.</p>
    <p>We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we've used examples from our services. But not all the services mentioned may be available in your country.</p>
