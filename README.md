## Create a new project `GoogleSearch`, that has the following pages:
- home page `` that displays the main page for the search engine (as seen below)
- Terms of Service page `terms/` that display the terms of service as seen in the second image below.

### Use Static files.
### Use dynamic URLs where applicable.
### Use Template inheritance.
### All the resources you need are in the folder `resources` included in this Repo.
### Use google fonts to get the same font.
### Use google icons for other icons that are not in the resources (choose similar icons)
